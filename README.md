This is a hobby project of building an ALU, CPU, computer, or whatever it ends
up as before I tire of it, from basic components. Think of it as a learning and
art project more than anything practically useful.

Inspirations include:

- [That ALU built in minecraft][minecraft]
- [Boldport Club][boldport-club] for sending me beautiful, fun, whimsical and/or
  useful kits to assemble; and for its community of other tinkerers showing off
  their projects
- [Crash Course Computer Science][cccs] for making me think "that should be fun,
  how hard could it be?"
- The [MOnSter 6502][monster] and [Megaprocessor][megaprocessor]

Special thanks also to the [Boldport Club][boldport-club] community for
providing newbie help as I try to figure these things out!
